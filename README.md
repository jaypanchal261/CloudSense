I developed a real-time weather dashboard using React, fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app displays current weather conditions like temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the userâ€™s location or a searched city. The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, providing quick access to accurate weather data.
## Features

- Live Location Weather Info
- Search Cities 
- Changing images and background based on weather condition
